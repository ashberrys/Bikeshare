# Bikeshare
This is an exploration of a Bikeshare Data set from Chicago, New York, and Washington DC from the year 2017.

# Description
This is an exploratory data analysis in R with data visualizations for the Udacity nanodegree for Data Analysts. This was created in R Studio using 3 csv data files.
The combined data sets are all from 2017. The age calculations added by me were the actual ages of the riders as of 2017. 
The data set has six primary columns: 
  1) Start Time
  2) End Time
  3) Trip Duration
  4) Start Station
  5) End Station
  6) User Type

Two additional columns were included in the NYC and DC datasets:
  1) Gender
  2) Age
